h2. What Framework Includes

This library contains extensions and additions to the .NET Framework.  
That is, the contents of this library are things you wish the .NET Base Class
Library (BCL) already included: generic data structures, generic algorithms, 
extension methods on BCL types and interfaces, and classes that express 
universally applicable Design Patterns.

h2. What Framework Isn't

This library must NEVER
- depend on any libraries beyond the .NET BCL
- include business logic specific to the end product
